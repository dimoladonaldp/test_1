<p class="post-content-text-info">
Reference to the Sting Ray usually brings to mind visions of a 375-bhp engine, fuel injection, a 4-speed transmission, and all the accoutrements of a competition sports car. However, this car can be obtained in much more docile forms which make it an ideal fast tourer for those who are not interested in the ultimate in performance. With this in mind, we selected our test car with the 300-bhp version of 327 engine coupled to an automatic transmission, and found that this "power team," as Detroit puts it, was remarkably lively even if some of the keen edge of the really hot version was lost.





</p>

<p class="post-content-text-info">
It is 10 years since the was first introduced, with the Sting Ray model following on in 1963, and the car has built up a remarkably enthusiastic following in that time -- even comparable to that of the Porsche. In fact, we were surprised to find that some Corvette drivers still wave to each other when passing, even if they do have a tendency to "whomp" their engines at traffic signals. However, it is definitely a most impressive car in many ways and seems to command a lot of attention and respect on the road.




 
</p>

<p class="post-content-text-info">
The body design of the 1964 Sting Ray remains little changed from 1963, although we were pleased to note that the central division in the rear window has been eliminated, with a consequent improvement in vision. The basic lines of the car are most original and extremely clean, but the hand of the stylist has been laid on it at some time so that a rather cluttered appearance results at some angles. Because the car is a "Detroit" product (Yes, we know it's assembled in St. Louis), one suspects immediately that the disappearing headlights are some sort of a sales gimmick, but they definitely do improve the aerodynamics of the car and also help to clean up the general appearance of the front end when retracted.






</p>

<p class="post-content-text-info">
There was some criticism of the quality of the fiberglass body when the Sting Ray first appeared, but we were unable to find any ripples or other faults on our test car. Furthermore, the other characteristics normally associated with fiberglass, such as a tendency toward drumming and magnification of noise, were not present at all, although an occasional creak was audible from somewhere around the rear window when running on uneven ground.






</p>

<p class="post-content-text-info">
The interior is very pleasing and well finished, and is laid out in the best sports car tradition. Bucket seats are provided for driver and passenger and there is considerable luggage space behind the seats. However, access to this space is through the doors alone, which is extremely awkward when bulky items are concerned, and if the rear window could be hinged in Aston Martin style it would be a great improvement. Another criticism concerns the space allotted to the driver, which is surprisingly small when one considers the overall dimensions of the car.






</p>

<p class="post-content-text-info">
Applying the standards we used in a recent article on the seating package in various sports cars ("The 99th Man," Jan. 1963) the Sting Ray didn't measure up well at all. Compared to the "average" sports car, the Sting Ray scored 68% and 58% (by the standard for the average and big man), while the average was 80% and 57%. However, provision is made for adjusting the steering wheel, although is cannot be done from the driving seat because it requires the application of a wrench to the steering column under the hood.






</p>

<p class="post-content-text-info">
In keeping with the other automatic features, the car was equipped with power steering, which we believe to be almost unnecessary on a Sting Ray, but was one of the best we have ever encountered. It was not noticeable at speed, but gave considerable assistance when parking. With an overall ratio of 17.6:1 and 2.92 turns lock-to-lock, the steering was fast, responsive and effortless, and well matched to the diameter of the wood-rimmed, 3-spoke steering wheel.






</p>

<p class="post-content-text-info">
One of the most interesting features of the car is the independent rear suspension, which is a very successful layout and also a big step forward for General Motors. The system is unusual because it employs a transverse leaf spring, but this apparently a matter of convenience because there is no room for coils. The two open double-jointed driveshafts make up the top member, and of course these are not splined. Two parallel lower arms pivot low down at the hub carriers and at the differential, and braking torque is transferred to the frame by radius arms.






</p>

<p class="post-content-text-info">
The result leaves little to be desired because there are none of those qualities, such as a tendency toward rear wheel steering, which one normally associates with independent rear suspension. However, one is aware that the car does not have a solid axle because a slight walking motion is evident under certain conditions of hard driving, but it is never sufficient to be disconcerting and the handling of the car remains completely predictable.






</p>

<p class="post-content-text-info">
The suspension as a whole is stiffer than we expected but not uncomfortable and does a good job on very bad road surfaces. It is helped considerably by a weight distribution which has a slight rearward bias and this weight distribution has also done a lot for the steering, to the extent that we feel it makes power steering unnecessary under most circumstances.






</p>

<p class="post-content-text-info">
On the road, the Sting Ray has a giant's stride due to its 300 bhp and 360 ft/lbs of torque at 3200 rpm. The automatic transmission is the Powerglide which, with its two speeds, is certainly not among the most effective transmissions on the market. However, this shortcoming is not particularly noticeable in the Sting Ray because there is power to spare throughout the speed range and the acceleration is exceptional whether the transmission is in high or low.






</p>

<p class="post-content-text-info">
As far as acceleration is concerned, we were able to draw an interesting comparison with the stick shift Pontiac GTO which we sampled at the same time. The Sting Ray tended to squat down on its rear suspension when leaving the line, with never so much as a chirp from its tires, and then gobble up the strip in 15.2 seconds after shifting itself smoothly into high range at 56 mph. In complete contrast, the GTO didn't want to leave the line at all, preferring to sit there burning rubber due to poor weight distribution and lack of an up-to-date rear suspension.






</p>

<p class="post-content-text-info">
To match the performance of the car, the brakes are adequate for normal fast driving but they will definitely fade and become uneven when used to the limit. When one considers both the weight and speed of the Sting Ray, it would appear to be an excellent car for a disc brake system, and it is surprising that General Motors has not yet adopted discs for this model.






</p>

<p class="post-content-text-info">
By offering an automatic version of the Sting Ray, General Motors has considerably increased its market for the car. This version is definitely not for the purists, but it is an excellent compromise for those families in which the little woman does her share of the driving, and it has decided advantages for anyone who does the majority of his driving in heavy traffic. With a price tag closer to $5000 to $4000, it is by no means cheap but, on the other hand, it still represents remarkably good value for money when one considers the performance combined with comfort, and the generally high standard of quality throughout the car.

As a matter of fact, we do recall reading some press release about Corvette discs, but surely they can't compare...




</p>

<p class="post-content-text-info"> 
Vented discs, 11-3/4 inches in diameter? Great resistance to fade? An absolute revelation when compared to the old Corvette brakes?




</p>

<p class="post-content-text-info"> 
That may be, but comparing old and new Corvettes is one thing; comparing the new Corvette with the Ferrari and the Aston is another. The Ferrari, for example, has an enormous 573 square inches of swept braking area and the Aston Martin has 468 square inches...which is by no means a meager quantity. By contrast the old Corvettes had a paltry 321 square inches.




</p>

<p class="post-content-text-info"> 
The new Corvette disc brakes have 461.2 square inches of swept lining? You have the effrontery to suggest that they form one of the really outstanding braking systems available on a production car today? The entire question isn't worth arguing about. The Ferrari and the Aston Martin and other similarly pedigreed European cars are simply not in a class with the Corvette. They have what you might call "breeding."




</p>

<p class="post-content-text-info"> 
Stop all the nonsense about the Corvette being as fast and as silent, as stable and as much in keeping with the grand touring concept as the other two. We don't want to hear how it might be argued that the Corvette is equally sophisticated from an engineering standpoint or that it might even be as well made. More reliable than an Aston or a Ferrari? Is nothing sacred?




</p>

<p class="post-content-text-info"> 
There is more to an automobile than dull, simple economic value or its performance capability. There's tradition and there's...tradition...and then there's...




</p>

<p class="post-content-text-info"> 
Anyway, you know what we're trying to say.




</p>

<p class="post-content-text-info"> 
This high output engine enjoys such tractability that it will pull smoothly from its 750 rpm warm idle in fourth gear. No flat spots, no hesitation, and no matter how fast you mash the throttle. Just to rub it in, you can start from rest in any gear whatsoever without stalling and with hardly a thought of the clutch lining. Strangely, starts in first gear seem equally touchy. Seems the "fast" clutch linkage (you have your choice of 4.5 or 6.4 inches of travel) has the unfortunate side characteristic that its mechanical advantage decreases quickly just as engagement occurs. For city traffic, we found that the combination of close ratios and the wide rev range made use of just first and fourth gears quite acceptable.

</p>

<p class="post-content-text-info">
It's not a low price car, and it's none too cheap to operate, but it goes well, it stops well, and with reservations, it corners well, too. For all around performance per dollar, the Corvette is hard to beat.
