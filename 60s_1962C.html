Zora Duntov says that as far as he's concerned, this is the last time the Corvette's power will be increased — within the present chassis, anyway. It's a reasonable statement, since it's hard to discern a need for more poke than the booming new 327-inch Corvette V8 provides. The 360-horsepower fuel injection version more than makes good on the public relations promise of "added excitement for those wishing the ultimate in performance."



</p>

<p class="post-content-text-info">
Recently we've always tested the hot fuel-injected version of the Corvette; we followed through on this with the '62 car. But in response to many requests from readers for data on a more normal go-to-market Corvette, we explored the opposite end of the range this year with the "small" (a miserable 250 horses) engine linked to the new aluminum-case Powerglide transmission. In this connection it's interesting that at Byrne Chevrolet's "Corvette Corral" in New York's Westchester County, the stock engine plus the four-speed box accounts for 80 percent of Corvette sales.


 
</p>

<p class="post-content-text-info">
First, let's look at this new 327-cubic-inch engine, which makes official what hot-rodders have been doing to Chevys for years now. It's definitely based on the 283-inch engine design, keeping the same bore center-to-center distance of 4.40 inches while increasing the bore 1/8 inch to an even 4.0 inches. (Since the new Chevy II four and six have the same center-to-center distance, with redesign they too could presumably abide a four-inch bore.) Stroke is stretched 1/4 inch from the 283's 3.0 inches. Though the 327's rod length and bearing sizes are unchanged, the rod does have a heftier shank section to take the bigger engine's higher stresses. For the same reason all 327s have the heavy-duty aluminum Moraine bearings that were used only on the hot 283s before.




</p>

<p class="post-content-text-info">
Last year's big-port head, with 1.94-inch intake valves, is now used on the top three of the four Corvette engine options. Only the base engine has the 1.72-inch intakes, fed by a normal four-barrel carb to deliver 250 bhp. The next hotter engine stays with the hydraulic-lifter cam but moves to the big-port head, and is equipped with a new oversized four-barrel Carter carb. Its output is 300 bhp, and it's still available with the Powerglide box. These two engines have double head gaskets for a compression ratio of 10.5 to one (actually about 10.2 to one); for the two top engines one gasket is pulled out to raise the c.r. to a nominal 11.25 to one, actual 11.1 to one. The Duntov solid-lifter cam is also fitted, output being 340 bhp with the big four-barrel and the aforementioned 360 with injection. The famed dual-quad layout, with all its complexities, is now entirely replaced by the new big Carter four-barrel.




</p>

<p class="post-content-text-info">
Rochester fuel injection goes into its sixth year of production with a major change to adapt it to the deeper breathing requirements of the big V8. Instead of the old relatively complicated cold start arrangement, the new injector has a simple choke valve in a port in the center of the intake venturi plug. When this "strangler" valve is open, the total area made available is adequate to the engine's needs; when it's closed, it has a definite choking effect although the venturi itself — necessary for metering reasons — remains open. Control of the choke is fully automatic.




</p>

<p class="post-content-text-info">
As always, the fuel-injected Corvette engine is a sweetheart to drive. Power is excellent, but even more impressive is the torque curve, which is as close to being flat as any we've seen. From its 4000 rpm peak it falls off only 20 pound-feet at the extremes of peak power (6000) and 2000 rpm. In action this engine delivers such constant thrust without surges or flat spots that the feel of acceleration is deceptively docile. The figures prove that performance is much like last year's f.i. Corvette (SCI, December, 1960) up to 80, above which the new one just continues to soar. Though the time to 80 is unchanged, time to 100 is cut from 18.0 to 16.6 seconds. Quarter-mile time is improved from 15.6 to 15.0 seconds, though the terminal speed is up only one mph to 95 — not bad for a stocker!




</p>

<p class="post-content-text-info">
With two aboard, normal tires, no positraction and a 3.70 axle, this Corvette was highly standard. The added power is such that once again rear-axle bounce is a problem on standing starts, in spite of the torque arms above the axle, so the times to low and medium speeds can't show improvement in proportion to the new output. Though the new engine's red-line is 6300 (down 200 rpm from last year), experienced Corvette test driver Bob Clift recommended that we shift up at 5600 rpm for best results over the quarter-mile. His tests have shown that rotating inertia forces above 5600 are such that the extra revs cost more power than they produce, in terms of acceleration. Top speed would be another matter, of course.




</p>

<p class="post-content-text-info">
When we jumped out of this injected bombshell into the basic Powerglide Corvette, we expected quite a comedown in performance; we were amazed at how little difference there was. Sixty in 8.8 seconds and the quarter-mile in 16.8 is, after all, not waiting around. Doing this by merely stepping down and holding on offers its own peculiar pleasure, as the solid V8 bites into higher and higher speeds with its distinctive hard, metallic wail. As a comfortable cross-country tourer, the Powerglide Corvette offers a high pleasure quotient.




</p>

<p class="post-content-text-info">
During our acceleration tests of the Powerglide car it was shifting up at 4500 rpm instead of the specified 47-4800 (tach red-line is 5500), but holding it longer in the lower cog didn't change the times significantly. It makes that shift at about 58 mph, automatically under full throttle, and kickdown can be obtained at any speed up to about 47 mph. Just easing away from a standing start with light throttle, it drops into high at 14 mph. There is some creep at a standstill, though no more than is usual nowadays.




</p>

<p class="post-content-text-info">
A downshift can be initiated by moving the floor-mounted control lever, but it's not the smoothest operation for braking purposes and the single low ratio isn't actually usable in the speeds where engine braking is most helpful. Thus we don't feel there's much to be gained by downshifting the box to slow down. This does give the brakes a lot of work, but even the standard Corvette binders are remarkably durable these days. For the sake of retaining maximum control, even on the highway, we feel most Corvette buyers will want one of the hand-shifted transmissions, but we'd suggest consideration of the Powerglide for a unique marriage of sports car handling and go with touring car convenience.




</p>

<p class="post-content-text-info">
For 1962 there are no Limited Production Options (LPOs) for the Corvette; everything optional fails in the RPO (Regular Production Option) category. In gearboxes for example the Powerglide is RPO 313, and for 1962 there's a new RPO 685 four-speed box that's sold only with the two milder hydraulic-lifter engines. It's ratios are 1.00, 1.51, 1.92 and 2.54, with 2.61 reverse. A specially-recommended axle ratio for use with this is the new 3.08 to one cog (RPO 203), a combination which gives an overall low gear of 7.83 to one, for blasting dramatically out of drive-ins and away from lights, yet offers a high highway top gear. Combining 3.08 with the original 2.20 would give a too-high bottom cog at 6.78 to one, so it can be said that the new box makes it possible to offer the 3.08 gear for the two quietest Corvettes.




</p>

<p class="post-content-text-info">
Positraction is still available, as RPO 675, as is the RPO 687 metallic brake and quick steering kit. You can get the brake linings alone as RPO 686, and, according to CORVETTE NEWS, you can buy over the counter the parts needed to convert to quick steering for about $25. You need one adapter plate, no. 3747588, two studs, no. 3747591, and one U-bolt, no. 2066840. That price would include installation and wheel alignment, according to CORVETTE NEWS. The latter, by the way, is one real bonus to buying a Corvette. It's a top-notch publication with all the factory dope on tuning, specifications and Corvette club activities.




</p>

<p class="post-content-text-info">
On the surface the 1962 Corvette is merely refined in detail. Its grille is now painted black, and the side cutouts are now fitted with fine-toothed "grilles" in place of the old triple dentures. Bright metal removed from this area has been placed low on the sides in the form of aluminum extrusions; this shouldn't be hard to remove. Under it all is the durable fiberglass body that's played such a part in keeping the Corvette's resale value at a remarkable high. The car isn't inexpensive but it's a good investment, both financially and in terms of some of the most exciting driving to be had.

Though a stiffer anti-roll bar would reduce the independency of the front end, the reduction in roll would certainly promote more driver security. The experimental seats helped, so did the seat belts.



</p>

<p class="post-content-text-info">
The steering, stiff for parking, was fine for controlling incipient slides, but as before, we found the throttle linkage much too sensitive. As a result, the car again appears to have two personalities. Either you motor sedately (though deceptively quickly) through a corner, or pressing on somewhat, you're herding an untamed beast, one which responds more to the throttle than the wheel, and rather violently, at that.



</p>

<p class="post-content-text-info"> 
In making up our list, the Cerametalix brake linings lost out as being entirely unsuited to highway use. When cold, they grab violently and erratically. Besides, they come only with the HD suspension.



</p>

<p class="post-content-text-info"> 
Using regular drums, the sintered metallic brake linings at only $26.90 are so good and so cheap that they should be standard equipment. Though the 15ÃÂ° F. temperature during our test helped their heat dissipation, it gave us a chance to prove that they have no nasty habits when cold. Being inorganic, they don't soak up water either.



</p>

<p class="post-content-text-info"> 
Flared drums, standard on all Chevies this year, have a bell rim-like flange which helps scoop air in from the inboard side. Between these and the linings, we repeatedly made stops from 90 and over without a trace of fade or increase in pedal travel. Pedal pressure, though, is higher than with organic (asbestos) linings. Running against a mild breeze, we managed zero to 100 mph and back to a standstill in 26.4 seconds, a figure that could be improved upon with experience.



</p>

<p class="post-content-text-info"> 
Though it runs $484.20 more than the standard engine, we were anxious to see what the fuel-injected, hot cam V8's 290 horsepower felt like in a roadable Corvette. To its great credit, it must be mentioned that cornering antics have no effect whatsoever on throttle response. This is in great contrast to quad-equipped cars, whether single or dual. They will just plain quit in the middle of a hard corner.



</p>

<p class="post-content-text-info"> 
Racer Brown's chart (see Part II of his article in next months's issue) indicates that the all-out dual-quad version boasts better output than FI-cars at the top end. However, the ability of the latter to mix correct quantities of fuel and air, no matter what the car's gyrations or speed, assures it of better lap times on any circuit.



</p>

<p class="post-content-text-info"> 
That one Corvette is not the same as another is evident from the variety of options. What comes as a considerable surprise is the dualistic personality of the particular car tested. In the twinkling of a throttle linkage, it turns from a submissive, sidewalk stalker to a fierce, roaring eater-upper of metallic monsters. Just as quickly, it reverts to silent smoothness, its exhaust murmuring, barely audibly, "Who, me?"



</p>

<p class="post-content-text-info"> 
This high output engine enjoys such tractability that it will pull smoothly from its 750 rpm warm idle in fourth gear. No flat spots, no hesitation, and no matter how fast you mash the throttle. Just to rub it in, you can start from rest in any gear whatsoever without stalling and with hardly a thought of the clutch lining. Strangely, starts in first gear seem equally touchy. Seems the "fast" clutch linkage (you have your choice of 4.5 or 6.4 inches of travel) has the unfortunate side characteristic that its mechanical advantage decreases quickly just as engagement occurs. For city traffic, we found that the combination of close ratios and the wide rev range made use of just first and fourth gears quite acceptable.

</p>

<p class="post-content-text-info">
It's not a low price car, and it's none too cheap to operate, but it goes well, it stops well, and with reservations, it corners well, too. For all around performance per dollar, the Corvette is hard to beat.
