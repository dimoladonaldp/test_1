Chevrolet's injection is a premature baby, but it's still alive and kicking. It was prematured by a sudden jolt from the collective Plymouth and Ford styling departments, and without a major body change Chev needed a potent sales weapon. The decision to bring out fuel injection was made very, very late in 1956â€”virtually on the introduction deadline.

</p>

<p class="post-content-text-info">
At that time it was still what engineers call a "breadboard layout"â€”a combination of units that work properly, but aren't fully developed and integrated into one mechanism. It's still very much that way. Moreover, the Rochester engineers are very competent carburetor designers, but didn't have nearly enough time to adapt their techniques to the wholly different problems of injection. In spite of the fact that the new arrival had long been expected, its arrival was not without complications.

</p>

<p class="post-content-text-info">
The above are facts, but in spite of them the Chevy "Ramjet" constant-flow injector works very well indeed. The big question, of course, is: How does it stack up against carbs? To find out, we set up a full transcontinental '57 Corvette road test, involving our entire testing staff. On the West Coast an injected machine was obtained from the factory representatives, while on the East Coast a dual-quad version was provided by Alvin Schwartz Chevrolet and Shelly Spindel, of Brooklyn.

</p>

<p class="post-content-text-info">
As a result we have a lot of the answers, but not all, the doubt being due to slight variations between the cars tested, the injected car, with the hardtop alone, weighed 120 pounds less than the carbed machine, which was toting the more complex soft top mechanism. Also, rear end ratios were 3.70 with the injector and 3.55 with the carbs. Advantage is taken of the better fuel distribution of FI by upping the compression ratio to 10.5/1, while the standard car had 9.5/1. This is a logical follow-up step, and does not "favor" the injection so far as our tests are concerned. The same can't be said of the weight and rear end discrepancies, which would tend to help the FI car at the bottom end, though very slightly.

</p>

<p class="post-content-text-info">
Starting the dual-quad car was easy, by twisting the ignition switch, though some care was needed to avoid flooding on hot starts. Once warmed up, the idle was low enough at 500 rpm, but it was full of lumps and shook the car bodily. This can be handed to the competition cam, which was installed in both cars and checks out as seen in the sidebar.

</p>

<p class="post-content-text-info">
The power from this cam comes on strongly at about 2700 rpm and stays that way until about 5300, after which it falls off rapidly, apparently due to valve gear. At the end of a fast run, the idle was extremely bad, and after each stop in the braking test the carbs would stall the engine dead. The dual-quad setup is by now a familiar one, so rigged that the rear carb runs all the time and the front one cuts in only at about 2/3 throttle.

</p>

<p class="post-content-text-info">
The engine was cold when we first twisted the switch on the Ramjet Corvette, but the engine caught on the first spin, bursting into a wholesome clatter of solid tappets jingling at a warmup idle at 1400 rpm. We raised the hood and studied the injection system. It looked purposeful but very different from the racing-type setups we know best...at present. A tiny copper tube, about the diameter of a pencil lead, runs from the pump to each of the nozzles which are located on the manifold at each of the intake ports. The tubes look fragile. We looked with distrust on solenoids, diaphragms, flex-cable drive, and complex linkages each of which might be a point of failure.

</p>

<p class="post-content-text-info">
The single throttle body and venturi are not in accord with American ideas on racing injection, but resemble both carburetor practice and overseas applications. It's no handicap, as long as the orifice is big enough, and as long as ram intake tubes can be accommodated, and it gives very good metering for a wide operating range.

</p>

<p class="post-content-text-info">
As these points were observed the engine coolant rose to about 170 degrees F. and the idle dropped to a mere 1200. We had occasion to switch off, and the next lesson in FI came when we tried to restart. Nothing happened; the starter ground on and on and the engine didn't even cough. So we tried treating it like a flooded carbureted engine and put the throttle on the floor. The engine caught within three spins. The remainder of our test bore out the fact that, while Chev's FI has the cold-start problem whipped, hot starts are rugged unless you use this simple trick.

</p>

<p class="post-content-text-info">
Our test car's 1200 rpm idle seemed excessive and we experimented with this adjustment which is utterly simple and consists of a spring-loaded screw in the throttle body. Playing with this adjustment is not remotely critical and it is easy to obtain a decent idle of 450 to 500 rpm which is identical to the carbureted car. This casts interesting light on the controversy of continuous-flow injection versus timed-flow, Chev's being the former. However, there is so little torque at this rev level with the competition cam that it is very easy to kill the engine. Experiment showed that about 950 rpm is an all-around good idle speed. With this rapid an idle, you must first briefly engage high gear in order to slip silently into low when standing still.

</p>

<p class="post-content-text-info">
On both cars, the action of the throttle linkage itself left a lot to be desired. The accelerator pedal travel is so short that you can't feather these potent engines, and the action is erratic and plagued with lost motion. In the bargain, the dual quads are at their worst at the bottom end. As a result the throttle response of the standard Corvette was unpredictable and slow, though things do happen in a big way after it takes a deep breath. This was still a handicap to clean control and rapid downshifting.

</p>

<p class="post-content-text-info">
In sharp contrast, and making allowance for the tiny linkage, the throttle response with FI was instantaneous. It's as though there's a system of levers between the throttle, pedal and your back. Press the throttle a little bit and your back is pressed, NOW, to the same extent. Slam the throttle down and your back is slammed, NOW, even in high gear. Second cog is so close to high that the slam is only slightly harder, but low gear is fairly lowâ€”2.20/1â€”and it really delivers a punch. These things happened with the dual-quad engine too, but never with the immediacy of the injected Chev, especially at low revs and low manifold vacuum.

</p>

<p class="post-content-text-info">
The cold figures, available for your inspection, are pretty phenomenal. Injected and carb-fed Corvettes are closely comparable in performance, and both qualify as the fastest-accelerating genuine production cars SCI has ever tested. In fact, up to 80 they're not so far from the data posted by the Mercedes 300SLR coupe, which is generally regarded as the world's fastest road car. In low, the Corvettes zoomed up to 55 mph in a shade over five seconds, and in another nine they surged to 95 in second with very exciting verve.

</p>

<p class="post-content-text-info">
During the runs with the injected car, we were looking mainly for flat spotsâ€”the transition points in fuel/air metering that are often among the defects of the carb-fed, rather than injected, engine. There were none. The beef in the FI engine permits you to take off from standstill in top gear just by revving up to 1500 or so and letting the clutch out slowly. Our zero to 60 (actual) time in top gear alone was 13.8 seconds. Then we lugged the engine down to its smooth-running minimum in top gear, 14 mph, and accelerated using both full and partial throttle openings. There was no faltering, there were no flat spots. Power was generated smoothly and at an increasing rate until about 2800 rpm when the cam hit its stride and the car hunkered down and steamed into the distance. Elapsed time for 14 to 60 mph in high was 12.3 seconds, on the injected machine.

</p>

<p class="post-content-text-info">
The same continuous flow of power held good during hard cornering and braking. Under these conditions with the dual-quad car, the contents of the carb float bowls were slung away from their intended orifices and left the engine gasping for fuel. There was no trace of this with the FI Chev, which feels as though it could be driven upside down.

</p>

<p class="post-content-text-info"> 
In all the recent prophecies concerning FI, we've been assured that fuel economy will be improved. In SCI's tests, the FI version registered as much as 15 percent better gas mileageâ€”in spite of a lower gear ratio. Part of this gain is due to the FI job's 10.5 compression ratio. In spite of the high compression our test car's engine did not detonate even when lugging heavily in top gear.

</p>

<p class="post-content-text-info"> 
In the U.S. far more interest is shown in cars' sheer performance than in their fuel economy and we therefore normally restrict our fuel consumption figures to averages obtained in overall running. But because of the novelty of FI and because of the fuel consumption claims made for it, we ran precise fuel checks at steady speeds, using a Donat Gauthier 1/10-gallon fuel-measuring burette. The surprisingly good results for so potent an engine are shown in the data table. They suggest the fuel economy that's possible if you should choose to drive one of these injected cars sedately...which is not the kind of use they're built for. More important, they indicate the improved operating economy that can be expected when FI does become sufficiently inexpensive to be fitted to normal touring cars.

</p>

<p class="post-content-text-info"> 
To get more expert opinion than our own on Chev's FI, we turned our test car over to racing FI specialist Stuart Hilborn, asking that he drive it and give frank comment. This was Hilborn's first behind-the-wheel encounter with Chev FI and he gave the car a careful, critical workout. Then he said, "It's good. All I can find to criticize is its hot-start behavior and its complexity."

</p>

<p class="post-content-text-info"> 
As an addendum to the performance figures obtained, and to the comparison curve from our '56 Corvette test, we might mention the net horsepower ratings of the two 1957 cars testedâ€”in other words, the actual output at the clutch with all accessory leads subtracted. The injected engine delivers 240 bhp at 5600 rpm, while the dual-quad rig turns up 230 bhp at 6000. Last year's Corvette engine was very modestly rated at 225 horses, so the improvement this year is just what you'd expect from an added 18 cubic inches.

</p>

<p class="post-content-text-info"> 
Through a lot of flogging the Corvette clutch engaged clean and hard, yet was smooth enough to keep the car reasonably tractable in spite of its high low-gear ratio. There's nothing silent about the cogs in this three-speed Chevy box, and second emits a fine, healthy whine which rises to a high-pitched scream. Low has a growling howl, and in that gear the floor-mounted shift stick has an annoying chatter. Shifting is very fast, especially from second to top and back again. Powerful synchro eases that downshift, while the responsiveness of the injected version means no strain when double-clutching into the useful first gear. Chromed all over, the shift lever has a slippery feel. One test car had some sharp open threads just below the knob.

</p>

<p class="post-content-text-info"> 
Last year we beefed mildly about the Corvette's behavior at a standing start, and in the meantime the horses have gone up while the rear suspension stayed the same. Now the rear end gets utterly out of hand when the clutch goes quickly home. The outboard-mounted leaf springs just can't take it, and the whole axle shudders and bounces. It took a nice balance between engine revs and deliberate clutch slippage to provide a smooth yet catapulting getaway. Leaving some form of radius rods or Traction Masters off this car is like forgetting the shock absorbers on a Cadillac. Installation of Chev's "Positraction" limited-slip differential is no direct solution either, as it would only make it tougher for the right rear wheel to break traction cleanly without jouncing.

</p>

<p class="post-content-text-info"> 
The rear end is also the main weak point in the Corvette's handling. Up to the point of breakaway the front wheels are slipping somewhat more, due to the forward weight bias and the front end geometry, so the car is basically a strong understeerer. As the roll increases in a corner, though, which it does pretty rapidly, the high gear roll center builds up a heavy loading on the outside rear tire. At this point all that's needed to bust that wheel loose is a little more roll, a little tighter corner, a bit more speed or a bumpy surface. Any of these will ultimately cause rear end breakaway. At low speeds on a twisty bumpy road the rear gives ample warning for correction, but it goes early and combined with the understeer and the sheer size the Corvette can be a handful. On faster and better roads it's more at home, aiming and tracking very obediently, but on, say, damp concrete in a 75 mph bend the back end can be most unruly.

</p>

<p class="post-content-text-info"> 
Steering is just quick enough to get out of most troubles but the strong caster action means you have to work to do it. This is responsiveness to muscle, not will. Emergency-type cuts are hard to take because the slim-rimmed wheel is placed very close to the driver's chest, and his arms get crossed up fast. The wheel itself is impressive with deep finger notches and drilled spokes, but its appearance is out of scale with the massiveness of the rest of the Corvette.

</p>
	
<p class="post-content-text-info"> 
Generally, in fact, for a good-sized car the Corvette doesn't have very much room inside. The dog-leg at the windshield corner and the close-up wheel make it hard to get in and out, and the doors don't close solidly though they do have a strong hold-open catch.

</p>

<p class="post-content-text-info"> 
To the eye, the separately-adjustable seats look well shaped, but you still sit on instead of in them. Cushioning is firm and covering very smooth. Range of adjustment isn't wide; all the way back there's just barely enough leg room for the medium to tall driver. There's no excess room for the left elbow either. Head room is better in the convertible than in the hard top edition. In both cases visibility is good, the margin going to the hard top, and the curved windsh\$0H‹l$8H‹t$@HƒÄ _ÃÌÌÌÌÌÌÌÌÌÌÌÌÌHƒì(ƒ==¥  tH¥ è'Ï  Ç%¥     HƒÄ(ÃÌÌÌÌÌÌÌÌH‰\$WHƒì03ÿHÕ¥ ‹Ç9ı¥ u;H  H‹ËL²Ñ  H‰D$ LVÑ  Wè>Ï  ‹Ğ¥ …Àº   DÊ‰À¥ …ÀHEßH‹ÃH‹\$@HƒÄ0_ÃÌÌÌÌH‰\$WHƒì H‹úH‹ÙH…ÉtHƒ¹Ğ    tº   DBÿèƒ]ÿÿH‹Ïè{Ì  H…ÛtHƒ»Ğ    tº   H‹ËèŸ]ÿÿH‹\$0HƒÄ _ÃÌÌÌÌ@SHƒì@H‹3­Œ H3ÄH‰D$8ƒ¹”  ÿH‹ÙtpHƒ¹°    tfHƒ¹Ğ    tº   DBÿè]ÿÿHL$ ÿŠ	 ‹ƒ”  L5  H‹‹°   HT$(‰D$(H‹D$ H‰D$0èVÌ  Hƒ»Ğ    tº   H‹Ëèÿ\ÿÿH‹L$8H3Ìèâ¨ HƒÄ@[ÃÌÌÌÌÌÌÌÌÌÌÌÌH‰\$H‰l$H‰t$ WAVAWHìP  H‹n¬Œ H3ÄH‰„$@  L‹±¨  E3ÿH‹ñM…ö„r  I‹H…É„Y  €9-LL$0LD$@…Ú   HÿÁHÂg èoÈôÿƒøtM‹HÂg H‹Îèˆ¥  é  D‹D$0HT$@H~Ág è]ÁÿÿH‹øH‹ØH…À„A  D88t¶€ù:t¶Éÿ€ ˆHÿÃD8;uåHƒËÿff„     D8|H[uõL9¾Ğ   tº   H‹ÎDBÿè›[ÿÿH‹°   LCH‹×èØË  L9¾Ğ   tº   H‹Îè²[ÿÿH‹ÏÿÉÍŠ él  H„$@  H}Ág H‰D$ è‹ÇôÿƒøtM‹H|Ág H‹Îè¤¤  é7  ‹T$0HŒ$@  èn€ H‹èH…ÀuM‹H|Ág H‹Îèt¤  é  D‹D$0HT$@HjÀg èIÀÿÿH‹øH‹ØH…À„%  D88t D  ¶€ù:t¶Éÿg ˆHÿÃD8;uåHƒËÿD8|H[uõL9¾Ğ   tº   H‹ÎDBÿè‹ZÿÿH‹°   LCH‹×è8Í  H‹ÏH‹ØÿÌÌŠ H…Ûu&D‹L$0LD$@H‹ÕH‹ÎèRúÿÿH‹ØH…ÀtÿHL‰xëH‹ÍèÉz L9¾Ğ   tº   H‹ÎècZÿÿH…ÛtiD‹L$0H„$@  LD$@H‰D$ HÀg H‹Îèh£  M‹vM…ö…ıÿÿL‰¾¨  3ÀH‹Œ$@  H3Ìè¦ Lœ$P  I‹[(I‹k0I‹s8I‹ãA_A^_ÃH‹Íè=z ¸   ëÄÌÌÌÌÌÌHƒì8H¥  º   LIÍ  H‰D$ LíÌ  èØÊ  HƒÄ8ÃÌÌÌ3ÀH…Étf„     H‹I(ÿÀH…ÉuõÃÌÌÌÌH‹ÂH‹Ñ‹Iƒùtƒùt3ÀÃH‹R M‹ÈHƒÂL‹ÀéW€ H‹R M‹ÈHƒÂL‹ÀéD€ ÌÌÌÌH‰\$VWATAVAWHƒì H‹ƒÏÿHÇD$h    M‹áIÇ    E‹øL‹òH‹ñHƒ»Ğ    tWH‹ËDGèÄXÿÿE‹ÇI‹ÖH‹Îè¶  H‰D$hH…ÀtM‹ÆHZ¾g H‹Ëè
