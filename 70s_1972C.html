			<p>The 1972 Corvette</p>
			<p class="post-content-text-info">
			Average Value: $18,500

			</p>
			<p class="post-content-text-info">
Although its arrival was anticipated by consumers and critics alike, there were virtually no physical or mechanical changes made to the 1972 Corvette from the previous year.  In fact, the most dramatic “changes” made to the current model year involved items that were no longer available to prospective owners when ordering a new Corvette.




			</p>
			<p class="post-content-text-info">
To start, consumers could no longer order the optional ZR-2 package, due to General Motors elimination of the aluminum headed LS-6 from the Chevrolet engine lineup.




			</p>
			<p class="post-content-text-info">
Previously, consumers looking to purchase a Corvette had had the option of including the 454 cubic inch big block LS-6 either on its own or as part of RPO ZR2, but because of incredibly poor sales numbers the previous year (only 188 Corvettes with the LS6 engine and a meager 12 Corvettes equipped with RPO ZR2 were sold), GM felt that the eradication of the engine was a necessity.  To that end, only three engines were listed for the Corvette in 1972, which made it the smallest selection since the 1956 model.




			</p>
			<p class="post-content-text-info">
All three – the base optional LT-1 small block, and the optional LS-5 big block – were all carry over engines from the 1971 model year, and each of these had more conservative power ratings than their 1971 predecessors.




			</p>
			<p class="post-content-text-info">
All of the engines offered in 1972 suffered a loss in power because of the mandatory inclusion of emissions-lowering tuning that year.  Furthermore, as was becoming common amongst all automotive manufacturers, GM was now measuring engine outputs in the new SAE “net” measure for the 1972 model year.  The choice to use the net numbers instead of the “gross” horsepower measurements was the result of power losses caused by mandatory equipment such as the water pump, alternator, power-steering pump, mufflers, and air cleaner.  While the ratings were universally lower, they were also more realistic.




			</p>
			<p class="post-content-text-info">
The base engine, designated ZQ-3, was rated at a conservative 200 brake horsepower.  The LT-1 was rated at 255 horsepower and the LS-5 was rated only slightly higher at 270 horsepower.




			</p>
			<p class="post-content-text-info">
While some cynics were quick to criticize Corvette for the notable depreciation in horsepower from the previous model year, Motor Trend magazine gave the new offerings a favorable endorsement.   Motor Trend stated that “the LT-1 screams past those lifeless people ensconced in their movable living rooms laughably referred to as cars.  It is an experience that does not soon pass from one’s memory.”




			</p>
			<p class="post-content-text-info">
Additionally, then race-car driver Tony DeLorenzo test-drove the 1972 Corvette and stated “you can’t get a better overall performance car.  I’d be hard-pressed to find a better car for the money, then the ‘Vette.




			</p>
			<p class="post-content-text-info">
It’s just an incredible automobile.




			</p>
			<p class="post-content-text-info">
Perhaps the most unfavorable “cut” to the 1972 Corvette was Chevrolet’s failure to complete emissions certification of the Mark IV LS-5 in time to clear it for sale in California, where limits on oxides of nitrogen had been imposed that didn’t apply in the other forty-nine states.  Chevrolet knew that the LS-5 was capable of passing these tests, but Chevrolet had simply lacked the manpower to certify every engine/car combination that it had wanted to, and as a result, the LS-5 – due in large part to its low production numbers – was dropped from the test series.  Some critics have been quick to question Chevrolet’s decision not to fully support this certification process given that California contained the second-largest Corvette customer base (behind Michigan) at that time.




			</p>
			<p class="post-content-text-info">
Beyond the realignment of GM’s engine program, there were virtually no other notable changes made to the 1972 Corvette with the following exceptions: For 1972, the fiber-optic light monitoring system was dropped and an all-new center console was designed to take its place.




			</p>
			<p class="post-content-text-info">
Additionally, Chevrolet standardized the horn-honking burglar alarm, which was now included on every new model.  The alarm system could be armed and disarmed via a lock cylinder at the rear of the car.  When armed, the alarm would sound whenever either the hood or the doors of the car were opened.  The alarm – which utilized the factory car horn – would continue honking until the owner’s key was used in the special alarm lock cylinder.




			</p>
			<p class="post-content-text-info">
While there were virtually no appearance changes to the 1972 Corvette, the model year did mark the “end of an era” for the third-generation Corvette.  It would be the last model year to feature both front and rear chrome bumpers, a bright egg-crate grill, side-fender grills (later models do have functional vents and some have vent trim), and a removable rear-window (this last had been a standard feature from 1968-1972.)



			</p>
			<p class="post-content-text-info">
Pricing of the 1972 Corvette did decrease slightly thanks to the repeal of a Federal excise tax on December 11, 1971.  In total, 20,496 Corvette coupes with a base price of $5,533.00, and 6,508 convertibles with a base price of $5,296.00 were sold in 1972, which was an improvement of nearly 5,200 units over the 1971 model year.




			</p>
			<p class="post-content-text-info">
The 1972 racing season would continue to see a strong presence from Corvette, though the car itself would also serve as a test-bed for new tire designs being developed by some of the largest tire manufacturers in the business.  While the Corvette made an excellent race car, its combination of weight and speed were very demanding on the car’s tires.  Both B.F. Goodrich and Goodyear recognized (and decided to take advantage of) this fact to show Detroit that radial-ply tires were more durable and could be utilized on more vehicles than ever before – even under the toughest driving conditions.




			</p>
			<p class="post-content-text-info">
Goodyear would lead this “race-within-races” on the basis of outstanding performance (and race results) of Dave Heinz and Robert Johnson, who drove the No. 57 Chevy Corvette of Dave Heinz racing to a GT class victory (and took 8th overall) on February 6, 1972 at the “Six Hour Daytona Continental-World Manufacturers Championship Race” (more commonly known as part of “the 24 Hours of Daytona” today).  Far more impressive, however, was that this same team would take another GT finish and (an overall fourth place finish) on March 25 at the “12 Hours of Sebring.”  Their fourth place finish amongst all racing classes that year was the best overall finish Corvette had ever seen to that point in its racing history.




			</p>
			<p class="post-content-text-info">
If you want the fastest Corvette, however, there is no confusion. Order the LS6 — the 425-hp 454. It's like the LT1 only bigger. The LS6 is available in other Chevrolets, certainly in the Chevelle, but not with exactly the same equipment that makes up the Corvette package. It's a premium quality engine from the very core — double-shot-peened connecting rods, tuftrided crank, forged pistons — and you pay for it: $1220.70 as an option. But no corners have been cut. The price includes transistorized ignition, a double disc clutch (which not only has lower pedal effort and shorter travel but also enough torque capacity for long life even with a 3.08 axle ratio), and aluminum heads (which save 55 lbs.). It's Duntov's favorite engine and he's tortured because few customers can afford it.



			</p>
			<p class="post-content-text-info">
"Maybe for street engine I make mistake — aluminum heads are expensive and that weight doesn't matter on the street." But he's not going to compromise the performance just to take money out. And he has harsh words for the "bean counters" who occasionally eliminate a worthwhile option or feature. The L46 for example. Until this year you could buy a 350 cu.in. 350-hp engine with a hydraulic camshaft that had very nearly the performance of the LT1 but was also compatible with air conditioning. And you could buy it for about $150 compared to $483 for the LT1. "Redundant," decided the bean counters and axed it off the list. Duntov thinks otherwise.



			</p>
			
			<p class="post-content-text-info">
As for the engines that have survived, they have clearly suffered, not from the bean counters but at the hands of the emission control engineers. Dropping the compression ratio has pruned about 5% off the horsepower curves of all the Corvette engines and it shows up on the drag strip. The LS6 is fast, make no mistake — 13.8 seconds at 104.65 mph for the quarter — but the three 2-bbl. 435-hp 427 tested two years ago (September '69) turned 106.8 mph. Axle ratios enter in here. While the 427 had a 3.70, the LS6 was hobbled with a 3.36 which not only means that you just hit third gear before the speed traps but makes getting a clean start more difficult.



			</p>
			<p class="post-content-text-info">
The LS6 will definitely produce better times with a higher numerical axle ratio. And with a freer exhaust system. According to Duntov, 50 horsepower is lost in the mufflers. That, however, is life. You have to have mufflers on the street. California laws say they have to be quiet ones and the LS6's are — stifled even. The pulses are still distinct — when each cylinder is pumping out over 50 horsepower they couldn't be otherwise — but they're muted. Giants in padded cells. (Chevrolet used to offer a chambered-pipe outside exhaust system that cost about 10 fewer horsepower than the mufflers but that's too loud now....)



			</p>
			<p class="post-content-text-info">
As you would expect, the personalities of the LS5 and the LT1 are worlds apart. In performance however, they are neck and neck. With the 454 automatic, just stand on it and go. Even though it is 305 lbs. heavier than the LT1, it reaches the end of the quarter about 0.3 seconds sooner. Like the LS6, the LT1 is very difficult to launch properly — the close-ratio gear box is not really suitable for standing start acceleration — so that even though the smaller engine Corvette is traveling faster at the end, it takes longer to get there. Naturally, the 270-hp model takes the longest of all to get there — 15.55 seconds at 90.36 mph — and with its power-robbing options, it should be the slowest possible Corvette.



			</p>
			<p class="post-content-text-info">
All of the Corvettes would be quicker if a cold air induction system were available. The discontinued L88 had one — a backwards facing hood scoop — but it also let a lot of engine noise seep out which California didn't like — and it was in conflict with the emission control hardware — so it was killed. (Duntov wouldn't admit to any plans to revive it.) Cold air to the carburetor is particularly helpful in a Corvette because it has the least underhood area of any 8-cylinder Chevrolet — which means it suffers the most from high underhood temperatures. You can see it from the drag strip results. Each succeeding run is slower than the previous one until a final equilibrium is reached, usually 1-2 mph slower than the first run following a cool-off period. The high engine compartment temperatures are also transferred into the cockpit. Considerable effort has been made to ventilate the underhood area more effectively, the front fender vents help, but not enough to make the passenger compartment comfortable in hot weather. So unless you are intent on straight-line performance, we recommend air conditioning.



			</p>
			<p class="post-content-text-info">
Two different close-ratio 4-speeds are available on the Corvette, the normal one which Duntov says is plenty good enough for any kind of street use, and the M22, known as the "rock crusher" to those who can't remember M22. The difference between the two is the gears — a little straighter cut on the teeth in the rock crusher — and a great deal of noise. Both of the boxes shift alike because the synchronizers are the same. And they shift very well because of the Corvette's excellent shift linkage. Unlike other Detroit 4-speeds, the Corvette linkage is mounted to the frame — which means that it doesn't have to be rubber-isolated to avoid rattles and vibrations. So you get solid shifts but no lever buzz. The shifter is also adjustable for a shorter throw.



			</p>
			<p class="post-content-text-info">
They may have in the braking department, however. Corvettes have extremely powerful brakes and three of the four test cars easily lived up to expectation. But the fourth — the nose heavy, air-conditioned, all iron 454 — preferred to lock up its rear wheels early and could pull only a little over 0.8G and still maintain good directional stability. No brake system proportioning valves are used in the Corvette and although there is a considerable weight distribution variation between models, Duntov is convinced that none is necessary — but he planned to recheck the nose heavy car situation on his return to Detroit just to make sure.



			</p>
			<p class="post-content-text-info">
When it comes to handling, the variables are even more complex. According to Duntov, production cars can range all the way from 0.75 to 0.85G on the skid pad. The 454s are usually better because those models have a rear anti-sway bar which makes them almost neutral. But you can't count on it. There is a considerable variation in suspension rates: up to 10% in the springs and nearly as much in the anti-sway bars — they can't be produced to tolerances closer than that at a reasonable cost. And then there are the tires. For all considerations that make a good street tire — directional stability, ride quality, noise, etc. — the Goodyears are slightly better but the Firestones will usually generate a fraction more lateral force on the skid pad. Then there is car weight, which varied in this test from 3370 to 3675 lbs., and weight distribution. In this test the lightest car, the LT1, turned out to be best, circulating around the pad at 0.80G. It also had the least understeer.



			</p>
			<p class="post-content-text-info">
But on the road course it was almost impossible to feel the difference between the four versions. All of them understeer slightly — just the right amount in our opinion — and are extremely tolerant of driver technique. For those who intend to race there is an optional heavy duty suspension but it is so hard that Duntov doesn't think anybody could stand it on the street. And to discourage the masochists, he has fixed it so that you have to special order a heavy duty car — intended strictly for racing, with heavy duty brakes, clutch, rear end, etc. — and not a single convenience option, not even a radio, is available on that model.



			</p>
			<p class="post-content-text-info">
It's all a part of Duntov's loyalty to Corvette drivers. He wants them to have what they need — as opposed to what they think they need — in an extremely high performance road car. Because of that desire he frequently finds himself at odds with the stylists. The deluxe wheel cover option is a case in point. The Turbo-Flash styling adds 28 lbs. to the car and makes it impossible to dynamically balance the wheels. Duntov recommends the base hub-cap-and-trim-ring setup. And there have been even more serious conflicts over the basic body shape. Originally the stylists had a big spoiler slated for the rear of the current Corvette before it went into production. Duntov insisted that it be trimmed down to its current non-functional size. Testing had shown the spoiler pushed the rear down so hard that the nose came up, causing the front end to go light — far worse than no spoiler at all.




			</p>
			<p class="post-content-text-info">
Occasionally you find a problem that hasn't been fixed. On the 140-mph pass through Nevada in the LS5 we discovered that it would only run wide-open throttle for a few miles before it would overheat. When the subject came up later Duntov nodded — he knew it. It's because of the radiator shroud. You have to have it at low speeds so the fan will be effective but at high speeds it sort of corks off the flow of air that would otherwise be rammed through the radiator. He has the solution on the shelf — a shroud with flaps that open at speed — but the bean counters aren't too interested in that. And since it's not a safety consideration, there is no reason to press the issue. Duntov knows about discretion. It comes with age.




			</p>
			<p class="post-content-text-info">
Which is a subject he doesn't talk about much. He's close on sixty and it is weighing on him. But it doesn't stop him. Seemingly, nothing can. You see it when he drives. A few laps at the photographer's insistence — just to finish off. Never mind that it's just to use a roll of Tri-X. It's done right. Wide open throttle till the last millisecond — brake late — brake hard -- on the power early. Not a twitch in the line. Just a taste of tire smoke filters through the cockpit. Hell. Zora Arkus-Duntov will still blow the doors off 98% of the guys that buy his cars. And that bodes well for next year's Corvette.
