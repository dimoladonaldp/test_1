By 1981, the Corvette's styling was getting quite long in the tooth. It had been around since the 1968 model, and while great looking, the car had lost much of its performance heritage, wheezing out just 190hp from its lone 350-cu.in. V-8. It was the first year that no optional engine could be ordered.

<p class="post-content-text-info">
Despite its lowly performance stats and the fact that this was the last year a four-speed manual transmission could be had, the car sold quite well, with 40,606 coupes leaving the factory--only eight fewer than in 1980. Consider this: In the 1960s and early 1970s, no more than 38,000 Corvettes were ever sold in one model year, so GM must have done something right. Maybe it's just as well no performance engines were offered as gasoline quality was terrible, and 1981 was the first year for Computer Command Control, revolutionary at the time, but quite crude by today's standards. CCC automatically adjusted ignition timing and the air-fuel mixture on the first-year feedback Quadrajet, the last carburetor in Corvette history. In theory, the system worked well, but CCC was largely misunderstood by the technicians who had to deal with it when something went wrong.

By 1978, the Corvette's silver anniversary, the car had ballooned to 3,572 pounds, so in 1979, GM put the Corvette on a diet to shed 69 pounds. The following year, the car lost another 167 pounds and, in 1981, the Corvette was a trimmed-down 3,307 pounds. GM accomplished this through various means, including the introduction of magnesium rocker arm covers and a fiberglass-reinforced monoleaf rear spring, which weighed but eight pounds in contrast to the old spring, weighing a hefty 44 pounds.

<p class="post-content-text-info">
Other firsts in 1981 were that the cars were simultaneously built at two locations: the old St. Louis, Missouri, plant and a new state-of-the-art facility in Bowling Green, Kentucky, where all Corvettes have been built since. St. Louis employees painted the cars with lacquer, while the newer, more environmentally friendly enamel base coat followed by a clear coat was employed at Bowling Green. There are reports of about 100 Corvettes being painted with the new system at St. Louis, but supposedly none were ever sold to the public. Rather, they were offered to GM employees. The last St. Louis Corvette was built on August 1, 1981.

<p class="post-content-text-info">
The 1981 could be ordered with quite a few options; a few made their debut, specifically a power driver's seat and new Delco radios using electronic receivers. Both old eight-track and the newer cassette options could be ordered. Buyers also could choose from 18 exterior colors in 1981 and four two-tone themes. In 1980, just 10 exterior single colors were offered. About 100 two-tone cars were built in late 1980, prior to the start-up at Bowling Green, according to Mike Antonick's Corvette Black Book 1953-2006.

<p class="post-content-text-info">
With the prices of mid-year and early 1970s Corvettes pretty much out of the reach of a hobbyist, the 1981 is a great choice. These cars listed new for $16,258 and, loaded, could tap out at about $20,000, depending on options, the most expensive being $750 for the AM-FM ETR stereo with cassette/CB. We found four 1981 Corvettes for sale in the November 2006 issue of Hemmings Motor News, with asking prices ranging from $17,900 to $23,500, which shows they have held their value after 25 years and that any depreciation has ended. With prices of earlier Corvettes out of reach and plenty of forgery and made-up cars out there for sale, these somewhat misunderstood cars are certainly worth a look. While considerably underpowered in contrast to many other model years, at least they are affordable.
