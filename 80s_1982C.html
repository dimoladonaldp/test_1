<p class="post-content-text-info">
After General Motors opened the Corvette manufacturing plant in Bowling Green, Kentucky in the summer of 1981, many enthusiasts began to suspect that the arrival of a next-generation Corvette was imminent.  Their suspicions were correct.







</p>

<p class="post-content-text-info">
While most of the design specifics surrounding the new C4 Corvette model were still a carefully kept secret from the general public, it was known amongst automotive enthusiasts that a new model was coming, and that it would be another front-engine design keeping in the tradition of Corvette since 1953.






 
</p>

<p class="post-content-text-info">
Of course, it wasnâ€™t only the introduction of a new manufacturing plant that indicated a coming change in Corvetteâ€™s near future.








</p>

<p class="post-content-text-info">
Certain design changes to the 1981 C3 had already unveiled clues â€“ such as the introduction of fiberglass mono-leaf springs â€“ about what enthusiasts might expect from the next-generation Corvette.








</p>

<p class="post-content-text-info">
Despite the certainty that the next-generation Corvette was close at hand, a decision was made by General Motors brass to continue production of the existing Corvette for one final year.








</p>

<p class="post-content-text-info">
Chevrolet executives knew that testing out new manufacturing machinery and developing standardized assembly procedures made more sense when working on a familiar design, rather then trying to develop all of these production standards while simultaneously attempting to manufacture an all-new vehicle.  Hence, the 1982 Corvette would, for one last model year, continue to be a third-generation model.








</p>

<p class="post-content-text-info">

</p>

<p class="post-content-text-info">
Ironically, while the 1982 model would continue to carry forward traits from older-generation Corvettes â€“ the 1982 Corvette was the last of a generation which dated its basic body structure to the 1968 model and its chassis back to 1963 â€“ it would also continue to be a â€œtest bedâ€ for technology destined for the fourth-generation Corvette.








</p>

<p class="post-content-text-info">
Chevrolet recognized that it did not make sense to release a new drivetrain at the same time as a new overall design, so it was decided that the 1982 C3 Corvette would be fitted with the revised engine and transmission developed for the new C4.








</p>

<p class="post-content-text-info">
â€œItâ€™s a harbinger of things to comeâ€ said David McLellan, Chief Engineer for Corvette, â€œFor the 1982 model is more than just the last of a generation; itâ€™s stage one of a two-stage production.  Weâ€™re doing the power team this year.  Next year, we add complete new styling and other innovations.â€








</p>

<p class="post-content-text-info">
Although Corvette fans would actually end up waiting nearly 18 months before theyâ€™d finally be able to see the re-designed fourth-generation Corvette, they were able to see the future Corvetteâ€™s engine and drivetrain immediately.








</p>

<p class="post-content-text-info">
The new engine was essentially the time-proven 350 cubic-inch V-8 that had powered Corvettes since the mid-1950â€™s, though it now came equipped with a newly developed twin throttle-body fuel-injection system instead of a carburetor.








</p>

<p class="post-content-text-info">
The result of this change was the introduction of the first production Corvette â€œfuelieâ€ since 1965.  However, this wasnâ€™t fuel injection of the type that had been available like that found from 1957 thru 1965.  Instead, it featured an injector unit within a carburetor-like throttle body for each cylinder bank (a total of two injectors), while a crossover intake manifold fed the air/fuel mixture to the bank on its opposite side.  This process sped up mixture velocity for more complete combustion, which resulted in greater thermal efficiency and power, plus the added benefit of reduced emissions.








</p>

<p class="post-content-text-info">
Improved Computer Command Control (CCC) electronics, a technology that first appeared along with the lG4 California V-8 engine in 1980, governed the duration of injector opening in response to signals from various engine-mounted sensors.







</p>

<p class="post-content-text-info">
The new CCC was capable of making eighty adjustments per second (compared to just ten adjustments per second on earlier versions of the system).  The fuel delivery system was given the name â€œCross Fire Injection.â€






</p>

<p class="post-content-text-info"> 
The â€œCross Fireâ€ 350 was given the engine designation L83, and was rated at a respectable 200 bhp at 4,800 rpm, which was a 10 horsepower increase over the 1981 Corvetteâ€™s L81 engine.






</p>

<p class="post-content-text-info"> 
The engine also delivered a peak torque of 285lbs/ft at 2,800 rpms.  While neither of these numbers was overly impressive, the modest increases in horsepower and torque was still an improvement over the 1981 Corvette.  More important, though, was the fact that this horsepower increase was achieved while emission outputs were reduced at the same time.  Interestingly, the L83 engine was the only engine offered to consumers during production of the 1982 Corvette.






</p>

<p class="post-content-text-info"> 
Similarly, only a single transmission option was offered in 1982.  While a manual gearbox had been available in every Corvette built since 1955, the 1982 Corvette was only offered with a standard four-speed automatic transmission.








</p>

<p class="post-content-text-info"> 
Designated 700-R4, the four-speed automatic was basically a variation of the three-speed Turbo-Hydra-Matic with a long striding overdrive fourth gear added on.  The 700-R4 automatic was electronically linked to the carâ€™s ECM (Engine Control Module).  Shifts and the torque converterâ€™s lockup clutch feature were precisely controlled by the ECM, depending on varying speed and load data inputs.








</p>

<p class="post-content-text-info"> 
As before, there was a torque converter lockup effective on all forward gears except first. It used a higher first gear ratio (3.07:1) for improved acceleration.






</p>

<p class="post-content-text-info"> 
This synchronization between transmission and ECM was one of the most advanced setups ever developed for use in any Corvette to that point.

</p>
<p class="post-content-text-info"> 
Other mechanical changes to the 1982 Corvette included the addition of an in-tank electric fuel pump as well as a new fuel metering system which included a positive fuel cutoff to prevent engine run-on (dieseling.)


</p>
<p class="post-content-text-info"> 
A new solenoid-operated trap door was installed in the hood that opened at full throttle to allowed the engine to â€œbreatheâ€ better.  The charcoal air filtering element of the 1981 model was replaced with a paper element.  The exhaust system was extensively redesigned around a significantly smaller and lighter catalytic converter.


</p>
<p class="post-content-text-info"> 
The exhaust pipes leading into the converter were redesigned to deliver hotter exhaust gases to the converter to increase its efficiency.


</p>
<p class="post-content-text-info"> 
Outwardly, the base coupe model received few cosmetic alterations.  The most notable outward changes were the addition of â€œCross Fire Injectionâ€ labels above the front fender vents and a two-tone paint option â€“ silver over a deep burgundy â€“ that was reminiscent of the 1978 Pace Car Replica models (those these earlier cars were actually painted silver and black.)


</p>
<p class="post-content-text-info"> 
Similarly, the interior of the base coupes remained nearly the same.  Although not a unique feature to the newest Corvette, 1982 would mark the last year that an 8-track radio (RPO UM4) would be available to consumers looking to take possession of a future generation Corvette.



</p>
<p class="post-content-text-info"> 
To celebrate the departure of the third-generation Corvette, Chevrolet decided to offer a final commemorative â€œCollectors Editionâ€ model.  However, recalling their experience with the 1978 Pace Car Replicas â€“ namely, the number of bogus Pace Cars that were created by consumers who converted base level coupes into Pace Car â€œclonesâ€ â€“ it was decided that the 1982 Collector Edition Corvettes would be built only â€œas neededâ€ to satisfy customer orders.  Additionally, unique vehicle identification plates were affixed to help further deter someone from turning a standard car into a Collectors Edition knock-off.



</p>
<p class="post-content-text-info"> 
For many enthusiasts and critics alike, the 1982 Collectors Edition Corvette was the best C3 of them all.  David McLellan stated that it was â€œa unique combination of color, equipment and innovation (resulting in) one of the most comprehensive packages ever offered to the Corvette buyer.â€



</p>
<p class="post-content-text-info"> 
First and foremost, the 1982 Collectors Edition Corvette introduced a frameless lifting rear-glass hatchback â€“ a Corvette first â€“ in place of the customary fixed backlight (which had been standard on the C3 since its introduction in 1968.



</p>
<p class="post-content-text-info"> 
The introduction of the rear hatch on the Collectors Edition C3 was a definite precursor to the next-generation C4 Corvette.  Aside from the glass hatch, the Collectors Edition also featured many unique accoutrements that set it apart from other 1982 Corvettes.




</p>
<p class="post-content-text-info"> 
Outwardly, the car featured cloisonne emblems â€“ including a special crossed-flag emblem on the hood that read â€œCorvette Collector Editionâ€ around the rim.  Addition emblems were located on the rear deck, and steering wheel.




</p>
<p class="post-content-text-info"> 
The car was finished in a special silver-beige metallic paint with graduated shadow-like contrast striping on the hood, fenders, and doors.  It received special bronze-tinted glass T-tops. It also featured finned â€œturbineâ€ alloy wheels like the ones first introduced on the 1963 split-window Stingray.




</p>
<p class="post-content-text-info"> 
Within the interior of the Collectors Edition, the car featured a silver-beige leather upholstery and door trim that matched the carâ€™s exterior paint color.  In addition to the leather upholstery, the steering wheel also received a matching hand-sewn leather wrap including the horn cap.
