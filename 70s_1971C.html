			<p class="post-content-text-info">
Steering gets plenty quick at 140 mph. And the suspension, which felt like flint on Sunset Strip, is supple, almost loose. In this high-velocity never-neverland all your senses need reorientation: A road that looks mirror flat pitches you violently up and down; the air makes tortured noises you hear right through the glass as it scrapes over the top of the windshield; an unseen force slowly twists and tortures the outside mirror until it surrenders and ends up pointing skyward.



			</p>
			<p class="post-content-text-info">
Keeping the car, and yourself, on the straight and narrow is so much a hairtrigger operation that it takes your logical conscience about three miles to break through your concentration — you haven't got time to carry on a mental debate about the morality of what you are doing. But when that logical, practical conscience does break through, it is not amused. Bad enough to spend a day driving to Nevada, but to tempt the worst kind of destruction by running a 454 Corvette right up to the redline in top gear and hold it there is damn near unAmerican. There is no defense. No rational excuse for driving along at double the posted speed limits in any other state.



			</p>
			<p class="post-content-text-info">
Rationale be damned; plead "temporary enthusiasm" and get it over with. And get back to the beauty of it. Because that's what happens. It happens to anybody who spends a few days with Zora Arkus-Duntov testing Corvettes of every engine description that Chevrolet makes in 1971: running them on the drag strip, around the skid pad and through a makeshift road course. And all the time talking to Duntov about it, about what he did to the suspension and the tires and the aerodynamics so that the Corvette is the only car built in America that can run 140 mph no sweat and the driver doesn't have to worry about becoming history.



			</p>
			<p class="post-content-text-info">
Later, when the driving is finished for the day, there is dinner and maybe a few drinks and more talk — talk about what it was like back when the Delahayes and the Talbots were trying to knock off the Mercedes and Auto Union juggernauts on the Grand Prix circuit; about how Duntov got the idea for the "Ardun" cylinderhead conversion while driving his flat-head Ford wide open across France one day before the war; about what it was like to work with Sydney Allard and drive an Allard at Le Mans and lose, then to switch to Porsche and win the class the next two years in a row.



			</p>
			<p class="post-content-text-info">
But whether it is between courses at dinner or while the condensation was running down a Martini glass, Corvettes are never far below the surface. Little by little glimpses of automotive history would come out — things that put today, and the 1971 Corvette, into perspective: That he had worked with a brilliant engineer named John Dolza on the Rochester fuel-injection and the system is fundamentally sound today except that cubic inches are a cheaper way to horsepower; that the "Duntov" cam was an emergency horsepower device he developed when Chevrolet wanted to crack 150 mph on Daytona Beach in 1956; the contempt Duntov feels for the body shape of the 1963-1967 Sting Ray because it had "just enough lift to be a bad airplane."



			</p>
			<p class="post-content-text-info">
There are discussions of current technology and sketches on napkins; penciled-in arrows show that air doesn't enter the radiator of the current Corvette through the grille — it is blocked off by the license plates and the head light shields — instead air is shoveled up by a spoiler below and behind the grille and enters the bodywork through two slots you can't even see unless you lie down in front of the car.



			</p>
			<p class="post-content-text-info">
There is an answer for every question and a reason for every one of the Corvette's characteristics. Duntov will talk of the battles and compromises that have been thrashed out between him and the stylists, product planners, and memo writers but he is adamant about one feature — throughout production he has stood firmly against those who would have reduced the Corvette's stability at high speed.



			</p>
			<p class="post-content-text-info">
That is why tires are designed specifically for the Corvette — N44 nylon cord — good for sustained 140 mph driving and they are used on no other American car. Duntov knows it is against the law to travel at that speed in every state but one and he doesn't care. If any Corvette driver, for whatever reason, should have occasion to drive at 140 mph the capability to do so safely should be built into the car. It's built into the suspension; the Corvette has more suspension travel than any other car manufactured in this country. If Duntov and the engineers desired, this travel would allow them to make a soft ride — softer than any of the performance cars — but then the Corvette would be likely to bottom out at high speed and it would be unstable. So the ride stays hard even if there is excessive travel by Detroit standards; that's the price you pay for 140-mph capability.



			</p>
			<p class="post-content-text-info">
The same design priority comes out again and again in discussions of brakes, steering, aerodynamics — the concern for the Corvette driver who may some day run his pinched-waist two-seater up to the redline and hold it there. Traditionally, top speed is something that only European car builders worry about. But when Duntov speaks, and you break your concentration on what he is saying long enough to notice how he says it, you know that he is closer to them than us. Although born in Belgium, he is a Russian, and all of the years after he left Russia — studying engineering in Germany, occupying his spare time with racing motorcycles and cars; the years in Belgium and France working on race cars and the highest output engines of the day (often supercharged) — have had as profound an effect on his automotive philosophy as on his accent. And his accent is a hardened alloy of old world structures and formations that 30 years in the United States seem not to have scratched.



			</p>
			<p class="post-content-text-info">
So you focus on the way he says his words, a way that is his alone, and you feel the intensity of his commitment to the Corvette and to engineering it to a level of performance surpassing all of the volume production cars in the world. Then, almost without noticing the transition, you find yourself in Nevada with the tachometer just a needle-width away from the red zone. The speedometer reads over 140 mph and you know that everything is all right, if it can ever be all right in any car, at that speed, because Zora Arkus-Duntov would settle for nothing less.



			</p>
			<p class="post-content-text-info">
Obviously this is no ordinary road test. But then how could it be when it's about a man so rare and complex as Duntov and about cars so Detroit-yet-European as the Corvette. At this point it would be the worst kind of irresponsible journalism to say that Duntov is personally responsible for every nut, bolt and forging in the Corvette — dozens of Chevrolet engineers work on it. Still, over the years, it has been his vision of what a high-performance sports car should be that has transformed the descendants of the bulbous, indifferent 1953 Corvette into a two-place touring machine that can be successfully raced in the international GT category. So when you can have him — Chevrolet Chief Engineer-Corvette — present at the test to drive and explain why the 1971 Corvette behaves the way it does, the results have to be more meaningful.



			</p>
			<p class="post-content-text-info">
The project was simple at the start. Every year for the last five years C/D readers have voted the Corvette as Best All-Around Car in the world, bar none. Any car with that strong a rating deserves an in-depth review. That means all of the Corvettes, one with each engine. And a little patience, for unless you plan months in advance, having the whole cast show up in one place on one day is impossible. We settled for two on one day and three a few weeks later — the LT1 being in the line-up twice — and were fortunate in having Duntov present for both sessions.



			</p>
			<p class="post-content-text-info">
The test cars were all coupes as is the majority (62%) of the production run. While having at least one convertible in the test would have allowed an examination of that model, it would have also added an undesirable variable. The different sound qualities of the two body styles and the different car weights would have certainly clouded the clear picture we now have of the various engines.



			</p>
			<p class="post-content-text-info">
This is not to say that to have a valid test all participating cars should be equipped alike except for the engine. On the contrary, the Corvette has great latitude — it can be optioned as a luxury tourer or as a high-performance sports car — but the difference should hinge on the choice of engine. So we've divided the test cars into those two categories. Both touring cars have the low-compression, hydraulic-lifter engines and the relaxed nature of the powerplants is complemented by automatic transmissions and air conditioners. The performance models are equally distinct in their roles; higher-compression, mechanical lifter engines with close-ratio 4-speed transmissions, and to keep the weight down, no air conditioning. All of the cars have Chevrolet's "standard" axle ratio for the engine/transmission combination.



			</p>
			<p class="post-content-text-info">
Clearly, the 350 cu. in. 270-hp Corvette engine does not fall in the performance category. It is the lowest output 4-bbl. V-8 Chevrolet builds (available as an option in every model except the Vega) and it specializes in painless performance. It is quiet and completely without vice. Those who want to be comfortable and avoid the mechanical hassle but still go fast should opt for the LS5, the 365-hp 454. It's every bit as relaxed as the base engine but an ox for strength, able to turn an air conditioner compressor and quick quarter miles at the same time. Just don't forget the gas money.



			</p>
			<p class="post-content-text-info">
But those powerplants are of little interest to the Corvette purist, the man who remembers the soul and vitality of the high-winding fuel-injected 283 when it was the only street engine in the country that put out one horsepower per cubic inch. Today's equivalent is the LT1 — a solid-lifter 350 rated at 330-hp. The compression ratio has been dropped to 9.0-to-one this year, a giant step down from the 11.25 that some of the small-block Corvettes have had in the past, but it hasn't lost the vibrant, high-strung personality that made it famous. It's eager and it talks to you. Today it is probably even better known as the Z28, which is what it is called when ordered in the Camaro. Corvette engineers originated the idea so Duntov winces when you say the two engines are the same, but they are. Somehow, though, it seems less subdued in the Corvette, perhaps because of the fiber glass body which acts as less of a barrier to sound than the steel of the Camaro. In the LT1 you're always aware of the clatter from the solid lifters and the exhaust pipes radiate sound right up through the floor. It's a frustrated racer, a fact it never lets you forget.



			</p>
			<p class="post-content-text-info">
If you want the fastest Corvette, however, there is no confusion. Order the LS6 — the 425-hp 454. It's like the LT1 only bigger. The LS6 is available in other Chevrolets, certainly in the Chevelle, but not with exactly the same equipment that makes up the Corvette package. It's a premium quality engine from the very core — double-shot-peened connecting rods, tuftrided crank, forged pistons — and you pay for it: $1220.70 as an option. But no corners have been cut. The price includes transistorized ignition, a double disc clutch (which not only has lower pedal effort and shorter travel but also enough torque capacity for long life even with a 3.08 axle ratio), and aluminum heads (which save 55 lbs.). It's Duntov's favorite engine and he's tortured because few customers can afford it.



			</p>
			<p class="post-content-text-info">
"Maybe for street engine I make mistake — aluminum heads are expensive and that weight doesn't matter on the street." But he's not going to compromise the performance just to take money out. And he has harsh words for the "bean counters" who occasionally eliminate a worthwhile option or feature. The L46 for example. Until this year you could buy a 350 cu.in. 350-hp engine with a hydraulic camshaft that had very nearly the performance of the LT1 but was also compatible with air conditioning. And you could buy it for about $150 compared to $483 for the LT1. "Redundant," decided the bean counters and axed it off the list. Duntov thinks otherwise.



			</p>
			
			<p class="post-content-text-info">
As for the engines that have survived, they have clearly suffered, not from the bean counters but at the hands of the emission control engineers. Dropping the compression ratio has pruned about 5% off the horsepower curves of all the Corvette engines and it shows up on the drag strip. The LS6 is fast, make no mistake — 13.8 seconds at 104.65 mph for the quarter — but the three 2-bbl. 435-hp 427 tested two years ago (September '69) turned 106.8 mph. Axle ratios enter in here. While the 427 had a 3.70, the LS6 was hobbled with a 3.36 which not only means that you just hit third gear before the speed traps but makes getting a clean start more difficult.



			</p>
			<p class="post-content-text-info">
The LS6 will definitely produce better times with a higher numerical axle ratio. And with a freer exhaust system. According to Duntov, 50 horsepower is lost in the mufflers. That, however, is life. You have to have mufflers on the street. California laws say they have to be quiet ones and the LS6's are — stifled even. The pulses are still distinct — when each cylinder is pumping out over 50 horsepower they couldn't be otherwise — but they're muted. Giants in padded cells. (Chevrolet used to offer a chambered-pipe outside exhaust system that cost about 10 fewer horsepower than the mufflers but that's too loud now....)



			</p>
			<p class="post-content-text-info">
As you would expect, the personalities of the LS5 and the LT1 are worlds apart. In performance however, they are neck and neck. With the 454 automatic, just stand on it and go. Even though it is 305 lbs. heavier than the LT1, it reaches the end of the quarter about 0.3 seconds sooner. Like the LS6, the LT1 is very difficult to launch properly — the close-ratio gear box is not really suitable for standing start acceleration — so that even though the smaller engine Corvette is traveling faster at the end, it takes longer to get there. Naturally, the 270-hp model takes the longest of all to get there — 15.55 seconds at 90.36 mph — and with its power-robbing options, it should be the slowest possible Corvette.



			</p>
			<p class="post-content-text-info">
All of the Corvettes would be quicker if a cold air induction system were available. The discontinued L88 had one — a backwards facing hood scoop — but it also let a lot of engine noise seep out which California didn't like — and it was in conflict with the emission control hardware — so it was killed. (Duntov wouldn't admit to any plans to revive it.) Cold air to the carburetor is particularly helpful in a Corvette because it has the least underhood area of any 8-cylinder Chevrolet — which means it suffers the most from high underhood temperatures. You can see it from the drag strip results. Each succeeding run is slower than the previous one until a final equilibrium is reached, usually 1-2 mph slower than the first run following a cool-off period. The high engine compartment temperatures are also transferred into the cockpit. Considerable effort has been made to ventilate the underhood area more effectively, the front fender vents help, but not enough to make the passenger compartment comfortable in hot weather. So unless you are intent on straight-line performance, we recommend air conditioning.



			</p>
			<p class="post-content-text-info">
Two different close-ratio 4-speeds are available on the Corvette, the normal one which Duntov says is plenty good enough for any kind of street use, and the M22, known as the "rock crusher" to those who can't remember M22. The difference between the two is the gears — a little straighter cut on the teeth in the rock crusher — and a great deal of noise. Both of the boxes shift alike because the synchronizers are the same. And they shift very well because of the Corvette's excellent shift linkage. Unlike other Detroit 4-speeds, the Corvette linkage is mounted to the frame — which means that it doesn't have to be rubber-isolated to avoid rattles and vibrations. So you get solid shifts but no lever buzz. The shifter is also adjustable for a shorter throw.



			</p>
			<p class="post-content-text-info">
They may have in the braking department, however. Corvettes have extremely powerful brakes and three of the four test cars easily lived up to expectation. But the fourth — the nose heavy, air-conditioned, all iron 454 — preferred to lock up its rear wheels early and could pull only a little over 0.8G and still maintain good directional stability. No brake system proportioning valves are used in the Corvette and although there is a considerable weight distribution variation between models, Duntov is convinced that none is necessary — but he planned to recheck the nose heavy car situation on his return to Detroit just to make sure.



			</p>
			<p class="post-content-text-info">
When it comes to handling, the variables are even more complex. According to Duntov, production cars can range all the way from 0.75 to 0.85G on the skid pad. The 454s are usually better because those models have a rear anti-sway bar which makes them almost neutral. But you can't count on it. There is a considerable variation in suspension rates: up to 10% in the springs and nearly as much in the anti-sway bars — they can't be produced to tolerances closer than that at a reasonable cost. And then there are the tires. For all considerations that make a good street tire — directional stability, ride quality, noise, etc. — the Goodyears are slightly better but the Firestones will usually generate a fraction more lateral force on the skid pad. Then there is car weight, which varied in this test from 3370 to 3675 lbs., and weight distribution. In this test the lightest car, the LT1, turned out to be best, circulating around the pad at 0.80G. It also had the least understeer.



			</p>
			<p class="post-content-text-info">
But on the road course it was almost impossible to feel the difference between the four versions. All of them understeer slightly — just the right amount in our opinion — and are extremely tolerant of driver technique. For those who intend to race there is an optional heavy duty suspension but it is so hard that Duntov doesn't think anybody could stand it on the street. And to discourage the masochists, he has fixed it so that you have to special order a heavy duty car — intended strictly for racing, with heavy duty brakes, clutch, rear end, etc. — and not a single convenience option, not even a radio, is available on that model.



			</p>
			<p class="post-content-text-info">
It's all a part of Duntov's loyalty to Corvette drivers. He wants them to have what they need — as opposed to what they think they need — in an extremely high performance road car. Because of that desire he frequently finds himself at odds with the stylists. The deluxe wheel cover option is a case in point. The Turbo-Flash styling adds 28 lbs. to the car and makes it impossible to dynamically balance the wheels. Duntov recommends the base hub-cap-and-trim-ring setup. And there have been even more serious conflicts over the basic body shape. Originally the stylists had a big spoiler slated for the rear of the current Corvette before it went into production. Duntov insisted that it be trimmed down to its current non-functional size. Testing had shown the spoiler pushed the rear down so hard that the nose came up, causing the front end to go light — far worse than no spoiler at all.




			</p>
			<p class="post-content-text-info">
Occasionally you find a problem that hasn't been fixed. On the 140-mph pass through Nevada in the LS5 we discovered that it would only run wide-open throttle for a few miles before it would overheat. When the subject came up later Duntov nodded — he knew it. It's because of the radiator shroud. You have to have it at low speeds so the fan will be effective but at high speeds it sort of corks off the flow of air that would otherwise be rammed through the radiator. He has the solution on the shelf — a shroud with flaps that open at speed — but the bean counters aren't too interested in that. And since it's not a safety consideration, there is no reason to press the issue. Duntov knows about discretion. It comes with age.




			</p>
			<p class="post-content-text-info">
Which is a subject he doesn't talk about much. He's close on sixty and it is weighing on him. But it doesn't stop him. Seemingly, nothing can. You see it when he drives. A few laps at the photographer's insistence — just to finish off. Never mind that it's just to use a roll of Tri-X. It's done right. Wide open throttle till the last millisecond — brake late — brake hard -- on the power early. Not a twitch in the line. Just a taste of tire smoke filters through the cockpit. Hell. Zora Arkus-Duntov will still blow the doors off 98% of the guys that buy his cars. And that bodes well for next year's Corvette.
