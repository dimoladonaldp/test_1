<p class="post-content-text-info">
With each annual change, Zora Arkus-Duntov, the Corvette's godfather, has emphasized performance improvements. His theory is that to sell, the Corvette must first go. Styling has had its innings, too, but they have acted with more restraint than one expects from Detroit.


</p>

<p class="post-content-text-info">
Perhaps in acknowledgement to the discriminatory taste of the sports car market, external changes for '59 were of a customizing nature only. The washboard-like, phony louvers on the hood and the Pontiac-like silver streaks on the trunk lid are now things of the past. Inside, there are recontoured seat cushions, a reverse lock on the four-speed's shift lever and an open-at-the-top catch-all which fills the opening in front of the "sissy-bar". Also the doorknob and armrest have been moved. Engineering changes at the rear include newly added longitudinal radius rods to prevent axle wind-up and rearranged and recalibrated shock absorbers.

 
</p>

<p class="post-content-text-info">
In discussing the new seats with Mr. Duntov, he pointed out that this is one of the most difficult compromises to make in a high-performance car. "In a racing car, the seat is 100% for working, just like a stool by a lathe. But in a passenger car, you're lucky if it's a 'work chair' more than 10% of the time. It must be easy to get in and out of, and comfortable for lounging in. The high sides of a real bucket seat are just right for holding you in place but they don't meet these other requirements."



</p>

<p class="post-content-text-info">
Opening the trunk, later, we discovered an experimental seat cushion. We tried it and found it lets you sit a lot lower, accentuating the side support of the cushion edges and increasing headroom, too. The secret is foam rubber in place of the usual coil springs, the drawback is that it bottoms out too quickly on large bumps-sooner than the suspension. Oh, well, back to the drawing board.



</p>

<p class="post-content-text-info">
Commenting on the door handles, Mr. Duntov pointed out that after driving Corvettes for thousands of miles on the Proving Grounds, he decided to move them forward during a visit to Riverside, California when he had to borrow a raincoat (?). The one he got had cinch-straps on the sleeves and he kept opening the door when turning left!



</p>

<p class="post-content-text-info">
The sissy bar is unfairly named, it's really quite the thing for hanging on when the driver is trying to prove something or other. The trash tray appeals to us, too, though others have condemned it as unsafe. We suspect that someone must have been road testing with their knees tucked under their chin because it just isn't that low.



</p>

<p class="post-content-text-info">
The world's largest producer of automobiles, Chevrolet offers not just a wide range of models, but a staggering array of optional equipment on each model. As on the sedans, so on the Corvettes. Five variations on the 283 V8 theme are offered, three transmissions (two, three, and four speeds), four final-drive ratios, three brake lining choices and two suspensions, just to name the mechanical ones.



</p>

<p class="post-content-text-info">
There is some interlocking involved, for instance, you can't order the Positraction limited slip differential with Powerglide; the latter must have the 3.55/1 rear end and cannot have the 290 hp version of the Fuel Injection engine. On the other hand, the stiff suspension is available only in combination with the latter engine and Positraction.



</p>

<p class="post-content-text-info">
For this test, the editors of SCI checked through the list of equipment options, nominating those we thought would add up to the most desirable all-around Corvette that you can buy. We had in mind, not the all-out racing version sampled in the December issue but a happy compromise that would be suited to both serious traffic and casual racing.



</p>

<p class="post-content-text-info">
Having carefully selected our list, we were pleasantly surprised to find that the Chevrolet Division could put such a sample at our disposal immediately. Seems a fellow named Arkus-Duntov has a company car fitted out identically but for one exception. His car also has the quick-steering adaptor (3.25 instead of 3.7 turns lock to lock). Generally available only as part of the heavy-duty suspension kit, it's worthwhile on its own if you can stand the noticeably stiffer steering. And if you can get it.



</p>

<p class="post-content-text-info">
Omitted from our list were the heavy duty brake and suspension kits. For 1959, the heavy duty suspension features much stiffer springs than last year. In pounds-per-inch, the spring rate on the standard suspension, last year's HD kit and this year's are, respectively, 300, 340 and 550 at the front and 115, 125 and 145 at the rear. Though the kit's anti-roll bar diameter remains at 13/16-inches, the vast increase in spring stiffness contributes to both much flatter turns and much harsher bouncing. Nice for racing only, but not for the all-around usage we have in mind.



</p>

<p class="post-content-text-info">
Corvette cornering has been the butt of many rude remarks by the anti-roll brigade. Duntov had interesting thoughts on this matter too. "For flat, smooth courses, such as Le Mans or Sebring," he said, "the heavy duty suspension option is very effective. But because it is so much stiffer, especially in roll, it would actually be a hindrance on a bumpy circuit." An interesting thought, and interesting examples, too.



</p>

<p class="post-content-text-info">
With so much power so freely available, rapid cornering necessarily becomes a maneuver requiring careful control of all the elements involved.



</p>

<p class="post-content-text-info">
Though a stiffer anti-roll bar would reduce the independency of the front end, the reduction in roll would certainly promote more driver security. The experimental seats helped, so did the seat belts.



</p>

<p class="post-content-text-info">
The steering, stiff for parking, was fine for controlling incipient slides, but as before, we found the throttle linkage much too sensitive. As a result, the car again appears to have two personalities. Either you motor sedately (though deceptively quickly) through a corner, or pressing on somewhat, you're herding an untamed beast, one which responds more to the throttle than the wheel, and rather violently, at that.



</p>

<p class="post-content-text-info"> 
In making up our list, the Cerametalix brake linings lost out as being entirely unsuited to highway use. When cold, they grab violently and erratically. Besides, they come only with the HD suspension.



</p>

<p class="post-content-text-info"> 
Using regular drums, the sintered metallic brake linings at only $26.90 are so good and so cheap that they should be standard equipment. Though the 15ÃÂ° F. temperature during our test helped their heat dissipation, it gave us a chance to prove that they have no nasty habits when cold. Being inorganic, they don't soak up water either.



</p>

<p class="post-content-text-info"> 
Flared drums, standard on all Chevies this year, have a bell rim-like flange which helps scoop air in from the inboard side. Between these and the linings, we repeatedly made stops from 90 and over without a trace of fade or increase in pedal travel. Pedal pressure, though, is higher than with organic (asbestos) linings. Running against a mild breeze, we managed zero to 100 mph and back to a standstill in 26.4 seconds, a figure that could be improved upon with experience.



</p>

<p class="post-content-text-info"> 
Though it runs $484.20 more than the standard engine, we were anxious to see what the fuel-injected, hot cam V8's 290 horsepower felt like in a roadable Corvette. To its great credit, it must be mentioned that cornering antics have no effect whatsoever on throttle response. This is in great contrast to quad-equipped cars, whether single or dual. They will just plain quit in the middle of a hard corner.



</p>

<p class="post-content-text-info"> 
Racer Brown's chart (see Part II of his article in next months's issue) indicates that the all-out dual-quad version boasts better output than FI-cars at the top end. However, the ability of the latter to mix correct quantities of fuel and air, no matter what the car's gyrations or speed, assures it of better lap times on any circuit.



</p>

<p class="post-content-text-info"> 
That one Corvette is not the same as another is evident from the variety of options. What comes as a considerable surprise is the dualistic personality of the particular car tested. In the twinkling of a throttle linkage, it turns from a submissive, sidewalk stalker to a fierce, roaring eater-upper of metallic monsters. Just as quickly, it reverts to silent smoothness, its exhaust murmuring, barely audibly, "Who, me?"



</p>

<p class="post-content-text-info"> 
This high output engine enjoys such tractability that it will pull smoothly from its 750 rpm warm idle in fourth gear. No flat spots, no hesitation, and no matter how fast you mash the throttle. Just to rub it in, you can start from rest in any gear whatsoever without stalling and with hardly a thought of the clutch lining. Strangely, starts in first gear seem equally touchy. Seems the "fast" clutch linkage (you have your choice of 4.5 or 6.4 inches of travel) has the unfortunate side characteristic that its mechanical advantage decreases quickly just as engagement occurs. For city traffic, we found that the combination of close ratios and the wide rev range made use of just first and fourth gears quite acceptable.

</p>

<p class="post-content-text-info">
It's not a low price car, and it's none too cheap to operate, but it goes well, it stops well, and with reservations, it corners well, too. For all around performance per dollar, the Corvette is hard to beat.
